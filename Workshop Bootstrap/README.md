# Bootstrap Workshop (this workshop will help you to learn bootstrap)

- [Download this project](https://github.com/HananeJab/Sprint-3/tree/main/Bootstrap%20%26%20VueJs/Workshop%20Bootstrap) to get started.
- Open index.html in your favorite editor.
- What are you wating for?

Each assignment contains a couple of images that shows the desired result. I've decided to no include CSS editing in this workshop, but feel free to add margins under some elements to make it look better.

## Assignment 6: Tooltips

Javascript!

Time to name your images/kittens. Add [tooltips](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips) that tells the name of the image/kitten.

To do this tasks you'll need to use Javascript. Add all code into `<script></script>` at the bottom of `index.html`, just before `</body>`.

__Tips__: Easiest is probably to use `$('img').tooltip();` and then use `data-` attributes.

## Assignment 7: Update your own site

Add Bootstrap to the site you've been building, and update the elements so they look Bootstrap-ish (add classes & stuff).

I guess that's it. Congrats :)
